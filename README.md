<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project trains a CNN model to perform clothes classification. The project conducts training on 3 models and will be compared to get the best model. The model can classify ['T-shirt/top,' 'Trouser,' 'Pullover,' 'Dress,' 'Coat,' 'Sandals,' 'Shirt,' 'Sneaker,' 'Bag,' 'Ankle boot']

This model can be applied in e-commerce companies to classify goods from sellers (especially selling clothes) so that the goods sold can be categorized automatically.

**Note**: This project is still in Jupyter Notebook form. The next step is to carry out the packaging and deploying code process.


### Built With

These are list any major frameworks/libraries used to make the project.

## Background

E-commerce companies find sellers and buyers. The seller uploads data on the goods sold to the e-commerce application. Buyers hope to be able to find the items they want to buy quickly. Categorizing items uploaded by sellers is a challenge in itself for companies. Therefore, utilizing AI models to carry out classification automatically will increase work efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Business Values
- It can reduce manual work.
- It can increase customer satisfaction.


## Dataset
Using [Fashion Mnist dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/fashion_mnist).


## Next Step 
In the next step, we can carry out the packaging and deploying code to be implemented in the production environment.
